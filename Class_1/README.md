## Class

Java is an object oriented language and every part is an object.
For every object there is a class that define it, every part of code should be write inside class.

`Class` = `File`

Every class is define in it's own file.

Class is a way to categorize few object of the same kind.

## Java words

There is few words on Java that related to the langudge, For example:
-`class`
-`main`
-`args`

## Code Structure

* In the end of every command/line there is a need to insert `;`, If will not be it will be error.
* Name of a class will alway be sequence of chars and will start with capital letter - for example `Helloworld`.
* When creating new class there is a need to write the code inside `{}`.
* For every class there is main method - from this method the program will starts to run.
* The main method will always start like the following - `public static void main (String[] args)` which means:
    -`public` - This method is public, in everyone can use it.
    -`static` - We can run this method directly, without the need to create an object to start it.
    -`void` - This method does not return any values when executing it.
    -`main` - This is the name of the method
    -`(String[] args)` - Inside the brackets we insert the parameters that this method will get, in this example the method is expect to get a list of strings.
* For every method there is a need to start and finish the method using `{}`.
* Make sure to add proper identation when writing the code.

## Write code in Java

There are 3 steps to write program in Java:

# Write the code in Jave -
* The name of the file should be as the name of the class
* The file should be with the `.java` extention (Helloworld.java).
* There is a lot of IDE's to write the code at - also notes.

# Complie the code - 
* There is a need to complie the code from Java to languade that the computer understand - `bytecode`.
* The complation will make sure that the text that we wrote is valid.
* After the complation process there will be new file with `.class` extation (will be in the same name as the `.java` name) and will be in `bytecode`.

# Run the program - 
* We will run the program and make sure it's working and there is no `running errors`.

## Share code -
When sharing a code in java, we will share the `.java` file (and send it in `zip` archive).

## System class - 

`System.out.println("Hello World");`

When we using the `System class` we get a lot of method of Java system.
When we use `.` after System we can use the method of System class.
- `out` - standard output - default is the screen.
- `println` - a method that print and add a return key (to move to a new line after the print).
- `print` - a method to print without insert return key.
 * We can use the parameter of the println method that get the parameter of what to print - can be vars, strings...

## Documention

Above every class and method there will be a documention that will be for the programmer to explain the code.
* Full line of description - This kind of line will start with `//` 
* End of line - This description will be in the end of the line and will start in `/*` and will end with `*/`.

## Variables

Variable it's like a storge in the memory that have a name and contains a value of a type.
Type is a kind that the variable can get, this is kind of the types:
* Full Numbers -
 - `byte` - 8 bits
 - `short` - Full numbers, low storage
 - `int`- Full numbers, medium storage (most common)
 - `long` - Full numbers, high storage
 
 * Full Numbers -
